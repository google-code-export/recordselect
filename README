Recordselect
============

(c) 2007 - Lance Ivy

This ActiveScaffold-inspired plugin is a streamlined listing tool with a
dedicated purpose: to let you select one (or more) records from a possibly
large record set. It will report the selected record(s) to a given method
on the controller.

RecordSelect can also be used as a JavaScript widget. You can tie into a
JavaScript hook that intercepts the selection report so it reports client-
side instead of server-side.

To use RecordSelect in a RESTful API, add the following to your routes.rb:

  map.resources :model_id, :collection => {:browse => :get},
                           :member => {:select => :post}

This depends on the excellent Paginator gem by Bruce Williams. This simple
gem is available at paginator.rubyforge.org.
