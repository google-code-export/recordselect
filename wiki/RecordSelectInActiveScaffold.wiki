#summary ActiveScaffold: `form_ui = :record_select`

= Introduction = 

RecordSelect (RS) isn't just an ActiveScaffold (AS) add-on. It is, however, useful in AS. This HOWTO assumes you've already installed the plugin and included the CSS and JavaScript in your layout (see [Install] for details).

= HOWTO =

Let's assume that you have two models, NewsArticles and Authors, and every NewsArticle belongs_to :author. Let's assume that your goal is to set up the scaffold for NewsArticles so that the create/update forms use RecordSelect to pick the appropriate Author. To accomplish this using the default intelligence of these two plugins, you need to do two things:

  # Configure RecordSelect on the *AuthorsController*.
  # Configure the NewsArticles scaffold with `config.columns[:author].form_ui = :record_select`.

It's important to understand that the relationship between the two models is mirrored between the two controllers. The NewsArticlesController will display a form that calls RecordSelect via `/authors/browse`. If you want to customize which authors are returned in the result set (e.g. change the number of authors per-page), you need to configure RecordSelect on the AuthorsController.
