#labels Featured

==PREPARING==
  # Install Paginator
    `sudo gem install paginator`
  # Make sure you are including Prototype from your layout:
    `<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>`

==INSTALL==
  # [http://github.com/cainlevy/recordselect/zipball/master Download from GitHub] and unzip into vendor/plugins.
  # Then add the CSS and JavaScript to your layout by including the following line:
    `<%= record_select_includes %>`
  # [ControllerSetup Enable and configure it on a controller.]
    `class UsersController < ApplicationController`
      `record_select :per_page => 5, :search_on => 'username'`
    `end`
  # Optional: to use RecordSelect RESTfully, add the following to your routes.rb:
    `map.resources :model_id, :collection => {:browse => :get}, :member => {:select => :post}`
  # Now go ahead and [HelperExamples use it somewhere.]
