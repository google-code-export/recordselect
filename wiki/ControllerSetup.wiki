#summary How to configure RecordSelect on your controllers
#labels Featured

RecordSelect configures through one method with optional arguments, like this:

{{{
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  record_select :search_on => [:first_name, last_name]
end
}}}

The options you can pass are:

  * *:model*: the name of the model you want to expose. defaults based on the name of the controller
  * *:per_page*: how many records to show per page when browsing
  * *:notify*: a method name to invoke when a record has been selected, if you want server-side notification.
  * *:order_by*: a SQL string to order the search results
  * *:search_on*: a field name, or an array of field names. these fields will each be matched against each search term.
  * *:full_text_search*: a boolean for whether to use a %?% search pattern or not. default is false.
  * *:label*: a proc that accepts a record and returns a descriptive string. the default one calls :to_label on the record.
