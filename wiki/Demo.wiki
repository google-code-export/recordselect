RecordSelect's repository includes a demo application for you to play with. The demo provides good examples of how it can be used and how to use it. It includes:
  * a sample usage of the form helper
  * a sample usage of the link_to helper
  * proof that RecordSelect loads from a partial retrieved via AJAX

== Installing the Demo ==
  # grab the demo from Subversion
    `svn co http://recordselect.googlecode.com/svn/demo record_select_demo`
  # set up the database
    Copy config/database.yml.example to database.yml and set yourself up. Sqlite3 is great for this kind of stuff!
  # run the migrations
    `rake db:migrate`
  # make sure you have the Paginator gem installed
    `gem install paginator -y`
  # start the server and play around
